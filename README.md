# Project Name: PersonaBot

## Description

**PersonaBot** is an advanced humanoid robot capable of walking, with dual arms and dexterous hands. This project showcases its intelligent and natural interaction capabilities with humans using the latest multimodal large models. The robot not only performs end-to-end speech input to speech output with emotional responses, but also accompanies its answers with realistic, human-like gestures generated by motion generation models. Additionally, the robot displays a dynamic human-like face on its head's flexible screen.

**Key Features:**
1. **Mobility and Dexterity:** 
    - PersonaBot can walk, has dual arms, and dexterous hands, enabling it to perform complex tasks and interactions.
2. **Intelligent Interaction:** 
    - Utilizes state-of-the-art multimodal models to achieve end-to-end speech input to speech output.
    - Provides emotional responses and realistic human-like gestures during interactions.
3. **Human-like Presence:**
    - Displays a dynamic and natural human-like face on a flexible screen mounted on the robot's head.
    - Capable of holding a microphone and speaking into it.

**Project**
The core of the project is the "Demo Main Control Logic," which coordinates the robot's actions by interfacing with lower-level ROS1 and ROS2 nodes for navigation, arm control, and dexterous hand movements. Additionally, the software generates an HTML-based GUI for remote operators to control and monitor the robot in real-time.


## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.8+
Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

**Installation**
